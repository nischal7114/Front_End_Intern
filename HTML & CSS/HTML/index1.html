            Just testing Luffy image, so here is some information about him. Monkey D. Luffy is the adventurous teenager that puts together the Straw Hat Pirates in his quest to become the king of the pirates. He is stubborn, bull headed and emotional, but he also shows fierce loyalty to his friends and anyone in need of help. Using his Gum-gum fruit powers that turn him into a rubber man, he can take down any foe that gets in his way. With his trademark straw hat and his usual big smile, Luffy has become an icon of not only the show One Piece but of anime and Japan as well.
            Here is a line from Wikipedia:
        </p>
        <blockquote cite = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Piece">One Piece (stylized in all caps) is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Eiichiro Oda. It has been serialized in Shueisha's shōnen manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump since July 1997, with its chapters compiled in 110 tankōbon volumes as of November 2024. The series follows the adventures of Monkey D. Luffy and his crew, the Straw Hat Pirates, as he explores the Grand Line in search of the mythical treasure known as the "One Piece" to become the next King of the Pirates.</blockquote>
